The major stock market indexes broke countless records in 2017, rising consistently throughout the year. Investors were heartened by President Trump’s promise to cut taxes and regulations. Strong economic growth around the world and nary a sign of inflation also contributed to investors’ cheery mood.
After falling sharply in the hours after President Trump was elected in November, the stock market quickly reversed course. In January it rose sharply on hopes that Mr. Trump’s promised tax cuts would boost corporate profits. Stocks also were immune to a series of geopolitical disturbances, from tensions with North Korea to investigations into Mr. Trump’s ties with Russia. The markets ended the year on a tear once it became clear that tax cuts would become law.S.& P. 500-stock index2,700Daily closes2,650MAR. 202,600F.B.I. Director James B.

It started in March 2009, fueled by the belief that aggressive policies by the Federal Reserve would halt the stock market’s fall. It’s been rising ever since, propelled by gushers of money looking for rich returns. According to data from Edward Yardeni, the current eight-year run trails only the boom from 1987 to 2000.3,000S.& P. 500-stock indexScale is logarithmicto show comparablepercentage changes1,00023,219days1+295%4,494days100+582%51,839daysLongestbull markets+229%10432,248days2,954days+126%+263%11930194019501960197019801990200020103,0001,0002S.& P. 500-stock index63,219days1,826daysScale is logarithmic to showcomparable percentage changes+295%1+102%4,494days100+582%51,839days42,248days+229%Longest bull markets+126%3102,954days+263%11930194019501960197019801990200020103,0001,0002S.& P. 500-stock index63,219days1,826daysScale is logarithmic to showcomparable percentage changes+295%1+102%4,494days100+582%51,839days42,248days+229%Longest bull markets+126%3102,954days+263%1193019401950196019701980199020002010Technology was the top performing part of the stock market in 2017, up 34 percent. But it wasn’t the giant, household-name companies like Google and Facebook at the top of the list, even though those companies had banner years. Instead, it was slightly smaller — but even faster growing — companies, including the electronic-payments company PayPal and the interactive gaming company Activision Blizzard.S.& P. 500 sectors 2017 percentage changeTop performers within the top three sectorsInformation technology+34.3%Micron Technology+90.7PayPal Holdings+87.9Nvidia+84.9Activision Blizzard+75.6Lam Research+75.5Health care+26.4Align Technology+135.6Vertex Pharma.+105.2Centene+82.1Intuitive Surgical+74.5Illumina+69.9Materials+24.5FMC+68.0Avery Dennison+64.6Sherwin-Williams+53.7Albemarle+49.2Freeport-McMoRan+46.1Industrials+23.8Financials+20.9Consumer discretionary+15.0Utilities+11.0Consumer staples+10.4Real estate+6.8Energy–5.7%Telecommunication services–11.9S.& P. 500 sectors 2017 percentage changeTop performers within the top three sectorsInformation technology+34.3%Micron Technology+90.7PayPal Holdings+87.9Nvidia+84.9Activision Blizzard+75.6Lam Research+75.5Health care+26.4Align Technology+135.6Vertex Pharmaceuticals+105.2Centene+82.1Intuitive Surgical+74.5Illumina+69.9Materials+24.5FMC+68.0Avery Dennison+64.6Sherwin-Williams+53.7Albemarle+49.2Freeport-McMoRan+46.1Industrials+23.8Financials+20.9Consumer discretionary+15.0Utilities+11.0Consumer staples+10.4Real estate+6.8Energy–5.7%Telecommunication services–11.9The strong markets have pushed stock valuations to dizzying heights.
