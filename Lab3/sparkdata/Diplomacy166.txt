China was mentioned only in broad terms when President Trump announced plans to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. But the country was a major driver behind the action. China makes large amounts of steel and aluminum, flooding the global market with cheap products. That hurts American producers, though it makes steel cheaper for everyone who uses it.Targeting China alone wouldn’t work. It is the world’s largest steel maker, but sends only a tiny fraction of its output to the United States. Chinese steel makers serve mostly Asian markets.Top origins ofU.S. imported steelTop destinations ofChinese exported steelCanadaSouth Korea16%16%Vietnam10Brazil13Philippines6ThailandSouth Korea410Indonesia4India4Mexico9Pakistan32Malaysia2Hong Kong2Russia9MyanmarTurkey7Japan5Taiwan4Germany3Rest ofthe world472IndiaRest ofthe world22Top origins of U.S. imported steelTop destinations of Chinese exported steelCanadaSouth Korea16%16%Vietnam10Brazil13Philippines6ThailandSouth Korea410Indonesia4India4Mexico9Pakistan3Malaysia22Hong Kong2Russia9MyanmarTurkey7Japan5Taiwan4Germany3Rest of the world47India2Rest of the world22Instead, to hit China, the Trump administration must go much broader with its tariffs. While details are scant and the focus could change, the measures would hit steel from countries around the world, including from American allies like South Korea and Canada.The global nature of the tariffs has sparked worries that they will set off a trade war.Steel has long been a sore spot in trade between the United States and China. Washington has levied more tariffs and countermeasures against Chinese steel than it has against steel from any other place.1.China242.South Korea183.India164.Japan125.Taiwan126.Turkey117.Brazil88.Indonesia69.Mexico6Number of U.S. traderemedies in effectagainst steel imports10.Thailand411.Ukraine412.Germany2Antidumpingduties13.Italy214.Moldova2Countervailingduties15.Russia216.South Africa2Suspensionagreementsand undertakings17.Britain218.Vietnam214All others1.China242.South Korea183.India164.Japan125.Taiwan126.Turkey117.Brazil88.Indonesia69.Mexico610.Thailand411.Ukraine4Number of U.S. traderemedies in effectagainst steel imports12.Germany213.Italy214.Moldova215.Russia2Antidumping duties16.South Africa217.Britain2Countervailing duties18.Vietnam219.Australia1Suspension agreementsand undertakings20.Belarus121.Belgium122.Latvia123.Malaysia124.Netherlands125.Oman126.Pakistan127.Poland128.Romania129.Spain130.Sweden131.Trinidad & Tobago132.United Arab Emirates1American steel makers argue that Chinese steel hurts them anyway. Faced with American tariffs, the argument goes, Chinese steel mills simply send their products elsewhere. That drives down global prices and pushes other countries to export cheap steel to the United States.Appearing with Mr. Trump on Thursday, David B. Burritt, the chief executive of U.S. Steel, alluded to the idea when he referred to the steel trade issue as “the Whac-A-Mole game.”But any global trade fight goes back to China. Thanks to its rapid industrialization over the past four decades, China now makes roughly as much steel as the rest of the world combined. While it consumes much of what it makes, China is also by far the world’s largest exporter, although the amount it sells overseas has been on the decline.Largest steel producers900million metric tons800China700600500Japan400IndiaUnited States300RussiaSouth Korea200Germany100TurkeyBrazil0Italy’07’16’17Largest steel exporters120million metric tons100China80Japan’17*60RussiaSouth KoreaGermany40ItalyUkraineBelgium20TurkeyFrance0’07’16Largest steel producersLargest steel exporters900million metric tons120million metric tonsChina800100700China60080500’17*6040030040JapanJapanIndiaRussiaUnited StatesSouth Korea200RussiaGermany20South KoreaItalyGermany100UkraineTurkeyBelgiumBrazilTurkeyItaly00France’07’16’17’07’16Largest steel producersLargest steel exporters900million metric tons120million metric tonsChina800100700China60080500’17*6040030040JapanJapanIndiaRussiaUnited StatesSouth Korea200RussiaGermany20South KoreaItalyGermany100UkraineTurkeyBelgiumBrazilTurkeyItaly00France’07’16’17’07’16Largest steel producersLargest steel exporters900million metric tons120million metric tonsChina800100700China60080500’17*6040030040JapanJapanIndiaRussiaUnited StatesSouth Korea200RussiaGermany20South KoreaItalyGermany100UkraineTurkeyBelgiumBrazilTurkeyItaly00France’07’16’17’07’16Largest steel producersLargest steel exporters900million metric tons120million metric tonsChina800100700China60080500’17*6040030040JapanJapanIndiaRussiaUnited StatesSouth Korea200RussiaGermany20South KoreaItalyGermany100UkraineTurkeyBelgiumBrazilTurkeyItaly00France’07’16’17’07’16In taking aim at China’s steel makers with broad tariffs, the United States could hurt its trusted allies. Consider South Korea. China is the single biggest source of its imported steel. South Korea is also a major exporter to the United States. In terms of raw volume, however, South Korea’s exports to the United States total about one quarter of what it imports from China.Canada, too, imports steel from China and South Korea; it exports steel to the United States. While the United States stands as its biggest market for steel both coming and going, Canada exports more steel to the United States than it imports.America’s trading partners have room to retaliate. Some of the biggest steel exporters to the United States are some of the biggest buyers of American products.The European Union has said it would target bourbon, blue jeans and Harley Davidson motorcycles, products with an especially American flavor. Canada has also threatened to fight back.U.S. exports in 2017In billions, total: $1.55 trillion1586U.S.43729101. CANADA $2826. GERMANY $532. MEXICO $2437. SOUTH KOREA $483. CHINA $1308.

HONGKONG $4010.BRAZIL$37A trade war is far from guaranteed.China has put greater emphasis on exporting higher-valued products, like finished machinery and high-tech goods, rather than raw steel. Beijing may not want to endanger its markets in those products.But steel and aluminum may be only a first step. Administration officials have expressed concerns about China’s growing ambitions in industries like semiconductors, telecommunications equipment and other high-tech exports.
