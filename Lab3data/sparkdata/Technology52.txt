"Apple is still playing catch up to that."Overall, the Redmond, Washington-based software maker's revenue rose 16 percent to $26.82 billion, ahead of expectations of $25.77 billion.Net income rose to $7.42 billion, or 95 cents per share, from $5.49 billion or 70 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Analysts had expected earnings of 85 cents per share.
